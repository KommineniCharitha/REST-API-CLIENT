For the second task, I developed a Java program that fetches data from a public REST API using HTTP requests. The API used was GitHub’s public API, and I accessed it through Java’s HttpURLConnection class. The response, which was in JSON format, was then parsed using the org.json.JSONObject library to extract meaningful information such as username, followers count, and repository data. This task was also completed in Eclipse using JavaSE-22 and required an active internet connection. It demonstrated how client-side applications consume data from web-based services, laying the foundation for applications that display live, real-time information. It also emphasized the importance of RESTful principles and taught me how APIs are consumed in Java environments. Understanding JSON parsing and HTTP protocols is a valuable skill for any software developer, especially for those working with backend services, mobile apps, or cloud-based dashboards. This task directly aligns with real-world application development, especially in integrating third-party APIs, fetching external data, and building dynamic, data-driven tools.
